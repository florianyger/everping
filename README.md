## First step - reading and understanding subject (10 min)

Backend : Simple JSON file served by API, with a setTimeout

I will use fakerJS to generate JSON, i do not have time to generate lots of data manually

I will need : Express, Typescript, Nodemon, FakerJS

Searching for template ...

Found https://github.com/bpk68/api-server-starter-ts

I will integrate it to front end template.

------

Frontend : Simple table with pagination and filter

I will need : React, Typescript, Ant Design

I will use a template that i know
https://github.com/nbilalis/react-vite-ts-eslint-prettier-template

There are Vite, ESLint/Prettier/Airbnb codestyle, wonderful !

## Second step - project initialization (45 min)

Retrieve template, install Faker, Ant Design, Vitest, Husky.

Developing simple JSON served by API, according to template found, works like a charm, except module-alias.

No time to debug, we will import files the old way.

No time for cleaning useless files, sorry :)

Put a Ant Design button on page, and a fake test, all works !

## Third step - generate devices (15 min)
